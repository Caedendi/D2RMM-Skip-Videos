# Skip Videos for D2RMM

Remove the intro videos when launching D2R and the cinematic cutscenes when transitioning between acts by replacing them with empty files. Works with D2RMM. 

This mod merges [Skip Videos](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/331) by [Caleb and Friends](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/users/171503373) and [Skip Intro Videos for D2RMM](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/397) by [olegbl](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/users/353885) into a single D2RMM mod. <br>
Both video types can be either enabled or disabled using the D2RMM settings.
